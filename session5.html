### Adventures in 3d Printing

Okay, my previous experience with 3d printers is very simple, that being the fact that one of my good friends is obsessed with them. We call him the 3d printer guy and if in any situation we need a piece that has to be printed, we just call him up. So up until this point, I didn't need to use them myself. So this was an adventure for me. Thanks Ufuk, for all your service to our robotics team until now.

So the first thing I did was open up grabcad and search for the Fusion 360 3d designs, the thing I realized was that Grabcad is more work based when Thingiverse is more fun. Grabcad is a library for mostly engineers and they share their designs regarding solving a problem and it is mostly solidworks based. That was good for me until now because most of my experience relied on work based things rather than hobbies. But for this assignment the only thing that I could find on grabcad was a Captain America shield which would take a lot of time to print. 

So what I did was ending up switching to thingiverse, which I have never heard of before so it was exciting to see a place that is just a fun maker space where people can post anything rangig from complicated and compact gearbox designs to a design of a big ghost sculture for halloween. So the first part of the assignment required for me to print something simple, so I enede up researching 10 minutes 3d prints and found a cat design. Now I thought that was awesome because I love cats and also it seemed to be in a small design.

So the design that is found belongs to thingiverse user @mere and the design is called Lucy The Cat so to honor the creator I will refer to her as Lucy.

So the first problem that I ran into was a problem regarding SD cards, for some reason the SD card for Joon was not working for my computer. In that situation the best idea we could come up with was using a different 3d printer. And the second problem as I'm told everyone else also has is that the Original Prusa Drivers app is defaulted for a MINI printer when those are not the ones we have so I had to switched that but for printers that are similar, if you are running out of time, you can still go forward.

Here is the design seen in Prusa. It takes about 1.5 hours which is a bit longer than expected so I had to leave the printer running and go to dinner - as lab was closing -

So the next part of the assignment included for us to make a part for our final project design. Which for me was not going to work. As I talked about in my About Me page, I wanted to work with smaller robots, specifically in microbotics. Now since I currently don't have a Phd, that is not possible. But what I originally thought to use was building the skeleton that supports the bugs together - 4 at one - so the design was fairly simple.

For the Mit design which was something like

Since this was not going to work as a project, I needed to come up with something else, which when I do I will update the about page and hopefully this one will be something that can be achieved in the following weeks. Also for the skeleton, it might be better to not use 3d printer as it is originally made out of metal.

The next part of the assignment requires a scan

This is a scan of my roommates Harvard Bear: Harvey The Harvard Bear.
I used an app on my phone called Polycam

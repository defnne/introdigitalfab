  ### About Me

  Here is an image of my face : 

  ![image of me](./me.png)

  Greetings, I'm defne and I come here from Izmir. Izmir is in the Aegean Region of Turkey so it is close to Greece. I am a rising junior and I have always been very much into STEM. Which is why when I saw this class on the list, it was on the waitlist back then, I comletely lost it and I would just check the list everyday. So being in this class means a lot to me. I am a big fan of movies - especially a big fan of korean, japanese and hong kong cinema- , robotics, physics and science. I like to research as well.

 ### Project Ideas 

 The Micro Robotics (Or I Think It's called Microbotics) Bugs For Forest Fire Deduction 

 Now the idea for this project came to me after the events of last year in Turkey. Last year, there were forest fires all along the country but mainly on the Mediterranean Region. I had many friends who were afraid to go hlome or had to deal with their farms, homes burning. It was truly a time of crisis in which the governemnt did nothing to prevent this kind of tragedy. An event that would be funny if it wasn't so tragic was when the president threw bags of tea to those hurt by the fires while touring on a bus. These kinds of tone deaf behavior was causing hurt and seeing where the fires would be next was a struggle.

 Later that year, I first saw a research at MIT - also I saw a recently published article while in class as I was researching for this course -

The thing about this research that drew me to it was that for the future I thought compactness in robots would be important, and also I have seen a movie with nano robots and I really liked it. So I thought for a project I could design a small bug like robot that could detect the thermal rates in an area to see if there is risk of a fire.

I was hoping to do research on the fact that if this is possible or could it be done in a way. Hoping to look at the research existing both at MIT and other universities and robotic labs - as microbotics is a very important and promising future right now - I want to modify it.

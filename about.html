  ### About Me

  Here is an image of my face : 

  ![image of me](./me.png)

  Greetings, I'm defne and I come here from Izmir. Izmir is in the Aegean Region of Turkey so it is close to Greece. I am a rising junior and I have always been very much into STEM. Which is why when I saw this class on the list, it was on the waitlist back then, I comletely lost it and I would just check the list everyday. So being in this class means a lot to me. I am a big fan of movies - especially a big fan of korean, japanese and hong kong cinema- , robotics, physics and science. I like to research as well.

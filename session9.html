### Wifi, Bluetooth and Iot Devices

So for this week's project we were tasked to with:

Control a board from a local wireless network. Program a microcontroller to obtain and respond to information from the internet. Optionally, work with a partner to control a device over a remote server.

When I first read that I was unsure on what I wanted to do I had this idea of a buzzer that would help with house plants based on the temprature conditions because I come from a place where there is Mediterrenean weather and climate conditions so there is a very specific list of plants that can grow in these conditions.

But then I got a text from my friend Aubrey who was asking if I wanted to collaborate on the project and I accepted. So the idea that we came up with was basically a security camera that is web controlled - so like any other current security camera I don't know why I specified that - , now I thought that visual sensors would also help with my final project regarding house plants so I was happy to work with it.

Now the tutorial we followed was made by random nerd tutorials which was recommended in Nathan's website.

Now there are many tutorials on regarding building a security camera and I will be linking the one from Random Nerd here:

https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-web-server-camera-home-assistant/

So the code we based it of on is also there, we used Aubrey's computer to write it because I was having trouble with mine since session 7 when my Arduino IDE crashed and I had to switch to Arduino Cloud which is a weird process that usually ends up with many errors, I highly recommend to anyone who can to use Arduino IDE instead of Arduino Cloud because it really does not work that well.

So this is our set-up

![image of camera](./cameraesp.png)

this is how we wired the esp32 

![image of camera](./cameracode.png)

and this is our code

Here is the code we used:


<pre><code class="language-arduino">

#include "esp_camera.h"
#include <WiFi.h>

//
// WARNING!!! PSRAM IC required for UXGA resolution and high JPEG quality
//            Ensure ESP32 Wrover Module or other board with PSRAM is selected
//            Partial images will be transmitted if image exceeds buffer size
//
//            You must select partition scheme from the board menu that has at least 3MB APP space.
//            Face Recognition is DISABLED for ESP32 and ESP32-S2, because it takes up from 15 
//            seconds to process single frame. Face Detection is ENABLED if PSRAM is enabled as well

// ===================

And here is the camera working

A problem we ran into later was that while working in a place that is not the lab, there were struggles with which Wifi to connect to since Harvard University, Harvard Passpoint and Harvard Secure needed HarvardKey to access and our hotspots were causing small problems.

But overall, this was a very fun experience to work with Aubrey - don't tell her I said this but she is extremely cool - and I think this system might help with my final project design of whether to feed your plants or not.

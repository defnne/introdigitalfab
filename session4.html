### FORMULA 1 and A Testimony To Pain

Now, what do I mean by that? Great question and let me tell you. So our story starts with a concersation with Suvin where we decided that the best way to build a kinetic sculture for planes would be to actually make them move instead of turning them around, now this was my first mistake but I will keep making the same mistakes over and over again in the following 4 days. So I changed my plan from a plane to a formula 1 track when I was talking to two of my friends who are big fans of the sport. And I wanted to build something to make them happy when I realized one of them was having a bad week and the other was in Turkey - I missed her - So I decided to build the Monacco race track because it is the most famous one.

Now my biggest help in all of this was going to grabcad, grabcad as I mentioned is a place where cad designers come together to show off their designs and I found s trophy system of all tracks and I took the file which was a sldprt file and I changed it from a sldprt file to a dxf file. But this did not work so I was thinking what else could work when I thought to myself maybe I can do this indirectly by turning the sdlprt file from to an igs file and the igs file to an dxf file which worked. So one thing I learned from that was the fact that when things don't turn to each other the best way to go through with it is to make it something else first.
Here is the online platform I used to convert the files:

So I laser cut the track out of the laser cutter and I got the size wrong the first time and made it too small however with the help of kassia we made it bigger.

Now that the track was done, I needed a way to make sure that the motor would pass through them which the first idea that came to mind was of course gears. A gear box system that we could turn the belt around so I designed gears.

Now there were many problems with this which are the written as follows
I had to make the gear system out of cardboard which of course did not work but I had to because I made a total of 28 gears to cover the entire track and I couldn't cut that many gears out of achrallic or wood.
This did not work.
Now the second problem here was the gear idea didn't make sense, it wouldn't supports a system that big and also the motor wouldn't be able to pass through so this idea did not end up happening.

This is when I moved past to belting around the tracks, which was ultimately a better idea and I thouht could build a system that would supporr by both the inside and outside.
After giving myself a first degree burn while hot glueing the belt, I quickly realized that this was indeed not going to work because something needed to support the system so I started building holders
The holders are just 1cmX1m little squares out of wood and I didn't specifically build these out of cardboard because well it needed to support the system.

So now that these hold up, I could move on to making the motor which will not end up working for the reason that the belt was too tight in certain places and as Nathan said this technology might not apply to formula 1 also there was a disagreement about which motor to use and how to apply it but I learned that drilling a screwdriver takes about 30 minutes to make it fit to a motor and I was planing to making gears.

### Electronic Input Devices

So the assignment for this week included a making a capacitive sensor and a kit sensor.

So the story starts with me misunderstanding the assignment, for the reason that the link that led to the way capacitive sensors worked did not the first time. Which led me to many different ways people set up their capacitive sensors. The thing that I recognized - which was something that I should've realized sooner - that not every piece that looks like another piece is that piece. The types of sensors that I saw included: a penny one, electronic paint - apperantly that is a thing -, and one that claimed to be made with 1$ and aluminum.

In the end, Abi came to my rescue by showing me the page that was on the website and this time the link opened so I could just follow the link. So the thing that I realized that was the sensor works so much better when the insulator is thicker - as shown in the picture - so I used foam.

Trying the graph out, the highes I could push it to was 5 but when Suvin tried, it got to 6 most. 

<pre><code class="language-arduino">

int analog_pin = A3;
int tx_pin = 4;
int read_high;
int read_low;
int diff; 

void setup() {
    pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);      // Pin 4 provides the voltage step
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,HIGH);           // Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
    read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);  // Measure response of conductor 2.
    delayMicroseconds(100);              // Delay to reach steady state.
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,LOW);            // Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
    read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);   // Measure response of conductor 2.
    diff = read_high - read_low;         // desired answer is the difference between high and low.
    Serial.println(diff);
}
</code></pre> 

I used the same code that Nathan used.

### The Kit Sensor

So for the kit I chose a tempreture sensor. And I wanted to find a circuit design I could use, for that I used: https://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-thermistor-temperature-sensor-tutorial/
This website gives a detailed explanation about what a tempreture sensor is and how to make a basic one.

So I followed the same system

Which gave me the data

To get the extremes, me, Suvin and Emma had this idea to use hot and cold towels from the sink. So that is what I tried first

I tried to out it next to it, touch it, under it but the data set did not change. So I thought I could try to out a fan next to it with my friend but the most we could change it was one Farhenheit. So we assumed it might be the highest

So I was going to use my friend's fridge but my friend has left and I couldn't get to the dorm. And I don't own a microfridge. Also I don't wanna put my computer in a fridge. But after many tries the highest I could get the temprature was 106.05 F

So the code that was used was

<pre><code class="language-arduino">

int ThermistorPin = 0;
int Vo;
float R1 = 10000;
float logR2, R2, T;
float c1 = 1.009249522e-03, c2 = 2.378405444e-04, c3 = 2.019202697e-07;

void setup() {
Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {

  Vo = analogRead(ThermistorPin);
  R2 = R1 * (1023.0 / (float)Vo - 1.0);
  logR2 = log(R2);
  T = (1.0 / (c1 + c2*logR2 + c3*logR2*logR2*logR2));
  T = T - 273.15;
  T = (T * 9.0)/ 5.0 + 32.0; 

  Serial.print("Temperature: "); 
  Serial.print(T);
  Serial.println(" F"); 

  delay(5000);
}
</code></pre> 

I found code this code from the website as well. As an example.

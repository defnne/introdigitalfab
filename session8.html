### CNC, Milling, Casting, Molding and The Pain of How Much Machines Break Down

So this week we were learning about as mentioned in the title: CNC machines, milling, casting and molding. The assignment was to make something in Shopbot, to use the millling machine and make a mold.

For this week I normally decided to follow a theme and make them all inspired by shows and movies I liked. Now, it won't turn out that way because of some techical difficulties regarding the machines.

So the first part includes: CNC which would mean using the Shopbot

The original idea I had was to make an engraving of the Attack on Titan logo, because my boyfriend really likes the show and I wanted to do something for him. The shopbot uses .dxf files, which is a huge advantage. Since in Fusion 360, you can import .svg files.

How this works is first, you have to find a .png or .jpeg image of what you want.

For example mine was:

What you have to do after this is to find an online converter - I recommend convertio: https://convertio.co/png-svg/ - and converted your .png to .svg 

Fusion 360 supports .svg files so you can add that to your sketch by going on Insert.

and then your sketch will be opened for you to do whatever you want with and you can add that as a dxf file.

Now the sad part of all of this was that, this did not work on the Shopbot so I took Rhett's advice and did the simplest design I could which was an heart.

I still ended up gifting it to my boyfriend, and here he is looking very much dead inside after his midterm holding a cnc heart.

The second part is Milling, Molding and Casting

So for the Milling I chose to do my favorite movie's name which is In The Mood For Love. 

So I used the same method to insert the name on Fusion 360 and excurded it by 13 mm on the walls and 9 mm on the writing.

Sadly the Milling Machine Broke so the rest is to come.

### Laser Cutting and Love

Have you ever had that moment when you see a very nice picture on the internet and you, in your infinite wisdom decide that you alone can indeed recreate the picture?
That was what I went through when I first decided that my idea for this week was to create a maze, I thought that the lines drawn in Fusion 360 would be able to cut smoothly enough for a marble could pass through them. Spoiler alert: It did not work.

But here is the image that started it all:

So the first thing I did was to find a way to draw a heart in cad, which is much more complicated than it looks.

This video helped me both parameter a heart cam and also as you can see to draw one. The basic idea is by making it with the help of certain circles and the parameters that I used was: DIA, thick, sidelines, and hole - which is optional I just wanted to make a hole in the middle but it isn't necessary - Almost everything will be based on the DIA parameter so that is indeed important.

Here is how I used the parameters

So in my failed attempt at a maze, I did an almost Adobe Illustrator like drawing of the first picture, aka. the heart maze and it looked something like this

As I previously mentioned this didn't work. So I changed my game plan to make little hearts that will get between each other - which is where the parameter for sidelines comes in -

Okay so during the laser cutting process we ran into an issue with how the image of reflected in the actual laser cutter so make sure that your design is done from the top plane which makes it the easier to work with unless you want to change the placement of the shape to make sure it is on the ground dimension and not cutting it. Or like me you will have to do 13 attempts of the same things.

In the end the kerf was the firs problem. So the sideline length was originally 2 mm because I thought that the calculation for that was right and it wasn't. So I did double that, 4 mm for the sidelines and now the problem I ran into was that it was about double of what I needed. As you can see my dilemma, Nathan came in. And we had the idea to put them in my doubles instead of singles when assemblying. And then it actually worked.

So that was the end result, and what this experience showed me was that sometimes you have to be creative when assemblying or just creating and "Two Hearts Are Always better Than One"

### The Objects

I did a two birds one stone thing here and I had to design something for a club we had and I had to design something for here as well so I was like well yeah.

So The first thing I did is a front wing, for a formula 1 car, now what I mean by that is for a miniture small formula 1 car.

What a front wing does is "The front wing is a crucial part of an F1 car; it's the first part to hit the airflow, and therefore shapes the car's aerodynamics. It is steeply angled to turn the air up and over the bodywork, while the endplates smooth and condition the airflow around the wheels and into the sidepods." in Mclaren's words

And here is my design which I based as one of the pieces of the three as seen there so this is one of the pieces. Now the best part of designing on cad is someone somewhere did something close to it at one point in their lives and they have indeed uploaded it online so you can look at their parameters, youtube videos and design from that point forward. So what I did was search an air wing on grabcad, find a nice design and work on it myself. 

![image of wing ](./frontwing3.png)
![image of wing ](./front4.png)
![image of wing ](./frontwing5.png)
![image of wing ](./frontwing7.png)

So what I learned from this mostly is dimensions, and especially in solidworks the main point of the whole program and the biggest sell is the smart dimension system so as you can see from the picture getting it right takes a couples of tries.

Now this is originally what was supposed to be in the back but I made it too lean so ow I can just say it's a vase and what that thought me was to change the material in a system so I think this is copper or I tried to make it a type of copper but there are many many types of materials and also the color changes.

So the reason for specifically using copper was a old Turkish tradition or a specific use of kitchen utensils with copper so I like to think that this would've been a nice vase for my grandma's orchids because it is tall and lean.
